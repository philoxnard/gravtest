Gravity Initial Setup
=====================

Gravity is configured to run both on the host operating system using python and by running as a container with Docker.  You should follow the instructions in the appropriate documentation file for how you want to run Gravity.

It is recommended that you first start by running with python.  Development of the server will usually happen when running with python as well as it is quicker to make changes and doesn't require an image recompile.

## Getting Started
